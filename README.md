Scripts to generate quotation lists that are both exclusively free culture and machine-readable

This repository is...probably _not_ going to save the world.  However, I like to use the occasional quotation in header material for headers in writing, plus I try to throw something onto [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jcolag) every weekday.  Trying to be diligent about copyrights, though, makes it difficult to use conventional sources, so this set of scripts is (the start of) an attempt to build a quotation collection from Free Culture sources, whether public domain or under a public license.

I will publish the final collection of quotations when it starts shaping up.
